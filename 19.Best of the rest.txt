Impala:
Clodera's alternate to Hive
massively parallel SQL engine on hadoop
Impala is always running 
	avoid the start up costs when starting a Hive query
	made for BI style queries
Impala maybe preferred over hive when using cloudera
Impala is faster than hive,but hive offers more versality

Accumulo:
another BigTable clone(like Hbase)
offers better security model
	cell based access control
server side programming
preferred in case of complex security requirements

Redis:
A distributed in-memory data store(like memcache)
good support for storing data structure
can persist data to a disk
can be used as a data store,not just as a cache
popular caching layer for web apps

Ingite:
in memory data fabric
alternative to redis
closer to the database
	-ACID guarantees
	-SQL support
	-but all done in memory

Elasticsearch:
a distributed document search and analytics engine
really popular - 
	wikipedia,stackoverflow..
can handle things like real-time search-as-you-type
when paired with kibana,great for interactive exploration
amazon offers an elasticsearch service


Kinesis:
AWS version of kafka
Amazon has whole ecosystem on its own
	Elastic map reduce
	s3
	elasticsearch service/cloudsearch
	dynamodb
	elasticache
	AI/ML services
EMR - easy way to spin up a hadoop cluster on demand

Apache Nifi:
Directed graphs of data routing
	can connect to kafka,hdfs,hive
Web UI for designing complex systems
often seen in the context of IoT sensors and managing their data
Relevant in that it can be a streaming data source for streaming applications

Falcon
Data governance engine that sits on top of oozie
included in hortonworks
like Nifi,it allows construction of data processing graphs
but its really meant to oraganize the flow of data within hadoop

apache slider:
Deployment tool for apps on a Yarn cluster
allows monitioring of your apps
allows growing or shrinking the deployment as its running
