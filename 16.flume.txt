Flume:
another way to stream data into your cluster
made from start with hadoopn in mind
	-built in sinks for HDFS and HBase
	-can act as buffer netween hdfs and hbase
Originally made to handle log aggregation

Anatomy:
web servers - (source - channel - sink) -hbase

Components:
Source:
where the data is coming from
can optionally have channel selectors and interceptors

channel:
how the data is transferred (via memory or files)

sink:
where the data is going
can be organized into sink groups
a sink can connect to only one channel
	-channel is notified to delete a message once the sink process it

Built in source types
built in sink types

Using avro,agents can connect to other agents as well
smoothes the traffic - acts as buffer between your data and your cluster
