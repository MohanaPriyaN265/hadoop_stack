Querying data interactively:

Query engines:
Apache Drill - sql queries across hdfs,mongodb,s3...
	     - not cassandra
Hue  
Apache phoenix - sits on HBASE
presto - made by facebook,now an open source
       - works on cassandra,not on mongoDB
Apache Zeppelin


Apache Drill:
SQL for no-SQL 
Query engine for a variety of non relational databases and data files

hive,mongoDB,Hbase
flat json,parquet files on hdfs,s3,azure,google cloud,local file system
odbc/jdbc driver so other tools(like tableu) can connect to it just like
	a relational database 

based on google's Dremel

Still non relational databases under the hood
	internally data is represented as JSON and so has no fixed schema

joins across different database technologies
	like sql for entire database

****************************************************************************
example: import data into hive and mongoDB
	set up drill on top of both
	and do queries

Hive
Create database movielens;
upload data  from local  - ratings data

have mongodb import data from hdfs -user data

install drill - choose version compatable with the environment

start:
bin/drillbit.sh start -Ddrill.exec.port = 8765
#use port that is open and unused

enable storage plugins for hive and mongodb
edit the configurations and port numbers for hive and mongodb

SELECT * FROM hive.movielens.ratings LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM mongo.movielens.users LIMIT 10;

SELECT u.occupation,COUNT(*) FROM hive.movielens.ratings r
JOIN mongo.movielens.users u
ON r.user_id = u.user_id
GROUP BY u.occupation;

bin/drillbit.sh
